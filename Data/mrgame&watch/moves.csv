Judgement,sideb,,,49,,,,16,29,Special,"The first hammer in a match cannot be a 1 or 2.
The second hammer in a match cannot be a 2.
Any number the hammer displays cannot be obtained again until after 2 more hammers.
A death (fall or SD) will reset the rules currently applied to #3.
So long as the forward B animation starts, it will count as the next number. In other words: If you input forward B on frame 1 and are hit on frame 2, it'll still count as the number coming out.
