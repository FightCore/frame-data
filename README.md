# frame-data

The frame data for [FightCore](https://www.fightcore.gg) both in database form as
well as several scripts that have helped within the creation of this data.

The frame data is setup using Microsoft SQL Server 2022, the .bak file can be found
at `database/framedata.bak`. With an extra `.bacpac` provided for a smaller
download size.

## JSON and CSV files

In the `data` folder are the CSV files are a mix of different JSON and CSV files.
These are used in different FightCore products, but are free to be used by others.

> Please note that these files are generated by the `backend` project and edits
> will not be accepted in pull requests.

## Setup

There is a Dockerfile that can be used to not install SQL Server locally.
Note that this Dockerfile takes several minutes to build as it restores the database.
I'd recommend setting up a separate SQL server (can be done with the provided `database/docker-compose.yml`)
and restoring the data on there.

## Contributing

While we welcome others to contribute to the FightCore database, we would prefer
if these contributions would be in the form of SQL Scripts.
Both the backup files as well as the JSON in the `data` folder is only for generation
and not manually edited.
